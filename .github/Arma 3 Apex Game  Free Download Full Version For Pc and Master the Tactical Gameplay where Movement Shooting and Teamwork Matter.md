The expansion offers more potential with a stunning and sophisticated environment than a thrilling campaign experience. It is a good expansion, but annoying missteps are present here again. According to Metacritic[^2^], Arma 3 Apex has a score of 74 out of 100 based on 9 critic reviews.
 
Engage in Arma 3âs tactical gameplay, where movement, shooting, and teamwork truly matter, and make use of new vehicles, weapons and gear to overcome the challenges of a hostile foreign terrain. The Apex expansion represents the pinnacle of over 15 years of Arma development[^1^].
 
If you are a fan of realistic military simulation games, you should not miss this expansion. You can download Arma 3 Apex for free from Steam[^1^] if you already own Arma 3. If not, you can buy the bundle of Arma 3 and Arma 3 Apex for a discounted price.

One of the highlights of Arma 3 Apex is the new co-op campaign called "Apex Protocol". In this campaign, you take on the role of a NATO CTRG special operator who is sent to Tanoa to prevent a humanitarian disaster, but soon discovers a far bigger threat than expected. You will have to work together with your teammates to complete various objectives, such as infiltrating enemy bases, rescuing hostages, sabotaging installations, and more.
 
The co-op campaign consists of 7 highly replayable missions, featuring a drop-in/drop-out multiplayer structure, and the difficulty scales up or down based on the number of players[^1^]. You can play with up to 4 players online, or solo with AI teammates. The campaign is connected to the events in the original Arma 3 "The East Wind" campaign, and offers a different perspective on the conflict in the South Pacific region.

If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding co-op adventure in Arma 3 Apex, you should not miss the "Apex Protocol" co-op campaign.

You can also create your own co-op scenarios using the 3D scenario editor and the new environment assets and props for content creators[^1^].

To help you get the most out of Arma 3 Apex, here are some tips and tricks that might come in handy. Whether you are new to the game or a veteran player, these tips will help you improve your skills, avoid some common pitfalls, and enjoy the game more.
 
Tip 1: Use the Virtual Arsenal to customize your loadout. The Virtual Arsenal is a feature that allows you to access a huge variety of weapons, gear, and vehicles, and customize them to your liking. You can access it from the main menu under Tutorials > Virtual Arsenal, or from any ammo box or vehicle in the game. You can also save and load your loadouts for later use.
 
Tip 2: Learn how to use the new VTOL aircraft. The VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft are a new vehicle class in Arma 3 Apex, and they offer a unique way of flying and transporting troops and cargo. To use them effectively, you need to master the different flight modes: auto-hover, vectoring, and manual. You can switch between them using the F key (default), and adjust the thrust vector angle using the Q and Z keys (default). You can also use the auto-vectoring feature by pressing Ctrl+V (default), which will automatically adjust the thrust vector angle based on your speed and altitude.
 
Tip 3: Use the new Light Strike Vehicles for fast and stealthy operations. The Light Strike Vehicles (LSV) are another new vehicle class in Arma 3 Apex, and they are ideal for reconnaissance, infiltration, and extraction missions. They are fast, agile, and have low noise signatures, making them hard to detect by enemies. They also have a lot of storage space for weapons and gear, and can be airlifted by VTOL aircraft. You can find them at NATO and CSAT bases on Tanoa.
